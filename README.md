We were fortunate enough to have a word with Dr. Sanjay Kumar Pandey, NIC Director and Senior Technical Director of the Minister of Rural Development. He appreciated and loved the work on visualization and gave us feedback on what we could have done better.

"Designing a system for multi-hazard visualization as per location selected by an individual: A Smart Automation project for the Ministry of Rural Development
As part of the Smart India Hackathon, our team developed a web application that allows users to select various locations across India and view detailed information about the area, including previous natural disasters. The dashboard includes a map that displays past incidents, as well as charts and tables that provide additional insights.
One of the key features of our application is the clear and user-friendly interface that allows users to view different locations with different symbols and animations (refer slide no. 6) to represent various area conditions. We also implemented a map-based interface to make it easy for people to search and understand the area's condition.
We also provide precautions needed for particular natural disasters, depending on the user's visit purpose (tourist, businessman, land buyers, etc.). Using AI, we have also implemented a prediction system that forecasts the occurrence of disasters on the basis of past events. For example, the Kerala flood was caused due to excessive rainfall caused by a low-pressure area over the east-central region.
In addition to providing detailed information, we also provide different types of graphs, charts, and techniques for each type of disaster happening in that area to give users a deep analysis of the data and real-time conditions. We also provide a user input tool to gather and verify/update the given information about natural calamities and disasters.
